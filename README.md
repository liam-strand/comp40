# COMP 40: Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming

## Welcome

Hello! This repository contains all of my work for this course. To alleviate accademic integrity concerns, all assignment code is contained in git submodules that have more restrictive permissions than this repository.

If you would like to take a look at my solutions to these assignments, please reach out via email, GitHub issue, or carrier pigeon. I'd be happy to share the code with you!

## Repository Structure

* Assignment specifications can be found in `/specs`
* Assignment code is symlinked into this repository at `/hw[1-8]-*`
* Some lecture notes can be found in `/notes`. I'm not sure why you'd want to look at those though :)
* Code from a couple interesting labs are at `/lab[01|06]`. More lab code is available in the assignment submodules.
